## Hi, I'm Sergey 👋

**Sergey Dadoyan, M.Sc. - Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (University of Calgary)**

I'm a bioinformatician and data scientist who turns messy biological data into clear, decision-ready insights for biomedical and healthcare teams.

Recently, I completed my M.Sc. in Biochemistry & Molecular Biology at the University of Calgary, where I worked on how the epigenetic reader ING5 and oxidative stress shape transcription in mouse embryonic cells. Practically, that meant leading an end-to-end analysis of 50+ NGS/multi-omics samples in R/Linux: QC, alignment, differential expression (DESeq2), GO/pathway analysis, RT-qPCR validation, and integration with ChIP-seq and TCGA data.

### What I work with

- **Bioinformatics (3+ years):** RNA-seq & ChIP-seq pipelines in R/Linux (QC → alignment → counts → DE → enrichment); GO/Pathway analysis, GSEA, IPA, TCGA.
- **Statistics & data analysis (3+ years):** Classical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, chi-square, Fisher), PCA, correlation/survival analysis, data visualization in R.
- **Communication & teaching (9+ years):** Tutoring over 500 students in math, biology, chemistry, physics, and statistics; top-ranked tutor with TutorBright; passionate about explaining complex analyses to non-experts.

If you’re working on bioinformatics, healthcare data, or related tools and want to collaborate, feel free to reach out or open an issue on one of my repos.
