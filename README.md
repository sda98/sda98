## Hi there 👋

🔬 Researcher | 🎓 Mentor | 🧬 Bioinformatician

I specialize in leveraging data science and programming to analyze biological data from high-throughput sequencing experiments, including RNA-seq and ChIP-seq. Proficient in R and Bash, I develop workflows that demystify complex biological datasets.

I am also very passionate about education. Over the past eight years, I've mentored over 500 students across North America, working with prestigious institutions such as the University of Calgary, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Foothill College, and TutorBright as teaching assistant, academic counselor, and tutor-mentor.
