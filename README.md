## Hi, I'm Sergey 👋

**Sergey Dadoyan, M.Sc. - Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (University of Calgary) (2025)**

I'm a bioinformatician and data scientist who turns messy biological data into clear, decision-ready insights for biomedical and healthcare teams.

Recently, I completed my M.Sc. project about how the epigenetic reader ING5 and oxidative stress shape transcription in mouse embryonic cells. Practically, that meant leading an end-to-end analysis of 50+ NGS/multi-omics samples in R and Linux. Currently, I am working on analyzing and interpreting datasets from recent bioinformatics, statistics, and data science publications, including bulk and single-cell RNA-seq from immunce cells and intestinal tissues of the ulcerative colitis patients. You can find descriptions of my projects and the related scripts in my repositories below.

### What I work with now

- **Bioinformatics (3+ years):** NGS data analysis pipelines in R/Linux; GO/Pathway analyses, GSEA, IPA, TCGA.
- **Statistics & data analysis (3+ years):**  Hypothesis testing (T-tests, ANOVA, chi-square, Fisher), PCA, UMAP, cluster, correlation, and survival analyses, data visualization in R and Python.

If you’re working on bioinformatics, healthcare data, or related projects and would like to collaborate, please reach out to me over LinkedIn or by email. I am always happy to discuss how I could contribute to your work.
