## Hi there 👋

**Sergey Dadoyan, MSc - Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (University of Calgary)**

Data Scientist | Biologist | Bioinformatician | Top-ranked STEM Tutor @ TutorBright & Tutred 

’m a data scientist and bioinformatician who turns messy data into clear, decision-ready insights for biomedical and healthcare teams.
Recently, I completed my M.Sc. thesis on how the epigenetic reader ING5, together with oxidative stress, shapes transcription in mouse embryonic cells. I led an end-to-end analysis of a 2 TB RNA-seq dataset in R/Linux, which spanned quality control, genomic alignment, differential expression, GO &amp; pathway analyses, RT-qPCR validation, and integration of ChIP-seq and TCGA data. Currently, I’m co-authoring a review on ING4/ING5 complexes. 

What I bring:

• Bioinformatics (3+ years experience): Developing RNA-seq &amp; ChIP-seq workflows, and biological data interpretation (DESeq2, Gene Ontology/Pathway analyses, GSEA, IPA, CIIIDER, TCGA, Galaxy). 

• Statistics &amp; data analysis (9+ years experience): Classical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, chi-square, Fisher, and others), PCA, and correlation analysis. 

• Communication: 9+ years tutoring over 500 students in math, biology, chemistry, physics, and statistics; top-ranked TutorBright and Tutred tutor in Canada; skilled at translating complex concepts for non-experts.

I have an open work permit and am eligible to work full-time anywhere in Canada. I’m also fluent in English, Russian, and actively learning French (currently A2 CEFR level). If you need someone to develop and interpret complex biological/healthcare datasets, apply statistics, and clearly communicate the story, let’s connect.
