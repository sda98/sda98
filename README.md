## Hi, I'm Sergey 👋

**Sergey Dadoyan, M.Sc. - Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (University of Calgary)**

I'm a bioinformatician and data scientist who turns messy biological data into clear, decision-ready insights for biomedical and healthcare teams.

Recently, I completed my MSc in Biochemistry & Molecular Biology at the University of Calgary, where I worked on how the epigenetic reader ING5 and oxidative stress shape transcription in mouse embryonic cells. Practically, that meant leading an end-to-end analysis of a ~2 TB RNA-seq dataset in R/Linux: QC, alignment, differential expression (DESeq2), GO/pathway analysis, RT-qPCR validation, and integration with ChIP-seq and TCGA data.

### What I work with

- **Bioinformatics (3+ years):** RNA-seq & ChIP-seq pipelines in R/Linux (QC → alignment → counts → DE → enrichment). Tools: DESeq2, GO/Pathway analysis, GSEA, IPA, CIIIDER, TCGA, Galaxy.
- **Statistics & data analysis (9+ years):** Classical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, chi-square, Fisher), PCA, correlation/survival analysis, data visualization in R.
- **Communication & teaching:** 9+ years tutoring 500+ students in math, biology, chemistry, physics, and statistics; top-ranked tutor with TutorBright and Tutred; comfortable explaining complex analyses to non-experts.

### What I'm looking for

I hold an open work permit and am eligible to work full-time anywhere in Canada. I'm especially interested in roles where I can:

- Build and maintain NGS / omics analysis pipelines
- Apply statistics to real biomedical or healthcare datasets
- Collaborate with wet-lab teams, clinicians, and data scientists

If you’re working on bioinformatics, healthcare data, or related tools and want to collaborate, feel free to reach out or open an issue on one of my repos.
